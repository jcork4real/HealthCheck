# HealthCheck

Wanted to learn how to properly seperate the front-end (HealthCheck) with a standalone Angular project skeleton, and from the back-end (HealthCheckAPI) with ASP.NET core API, and having them configured to work together. Tested overall result locally to ensure everything was working properly.
