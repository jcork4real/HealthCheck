# HealthCheck

Wanted to learn how to seperate projects; the front-end (HealthCheck) which is a standalone Angular project skeleton, from the back-end (HealthCheckAPI) which is an ASP.NET core API. Then having them configured to work together. Tested overall result locally to ensure everything was working properly.
